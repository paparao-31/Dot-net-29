Form Validation

Build a Form Validation application where users:

	-> Enter data into fields like name, email, and password.
	-> Receive instant feedback if fields are invalid (e.g., missing input, invalid email format).
	-> Cannot submit the form until all inputs are valid.

-> Adding validation rules using JavaScript.
-> Manipulating form elements and displaying error messages dynamically.
-> Preventing default form submission using event.preventDefault().

Live Character Counter

Build a Character Counter where:

	-> Users type into a textarea.
	-> The app displays the number of characters typed and the maximum allowed.
	-> Highlight the text area when the character count is near the limit.

-> Using input events to detect changes in real-time.
-> Dynamically updating DOM elements.
-> Adding conditional styles for warnings.
