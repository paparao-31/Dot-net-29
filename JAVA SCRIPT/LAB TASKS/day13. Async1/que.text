	Coffee Machine Simulator


Simulate a coffee machine that:

	-> Prepares coffee in 3 seconds.
	-> Serves the coffee after preparation.
	-> Cancels the process if the user decides not to wait.
Requirements:
	-> Use setTimeout to simulate the coffee preparation time.
	-> Pass a callback function to serve the coffee after preparation.
	-> Allow the user to cancel the coffee preparation using clearTimeout.

	Reminder System

Create a reminder app where:

	-> The user sets a task and a time delay (e.g., 5 seconds).
	-> After the delay, remind the user about the task.
	-> Allow the user to cancel the reminder before it triggers.
Requirements:
	-> Use setTimeout to delay the reminder.
	-> Create a function to handle task reminders.
	-> Implement clearTimeout to allow canceling the reminder.

Que 3 :
-------

	Traffic Light Simulation

Simulate a traffic light system where:

	-> The red light stays on for 3 seconds, yellow for 2 seconds, and green for 4 seconds.
	-> The sequence repeats indefinitely.
	-> Cancel the simulation after a set period (e.g., 15 seconds).
Requirements:
	-> Use setTimeout to switch between lights.
	-> Use callbacks to create a sequence of events.
	-> Use clearTimeout to stop the simulation after a specified time.

	Countdown Timer

Create a countdown timer that:

	-> Starts from a given number (e.g., 10).
	-> Logs the countdown every second.
	-> Cancels the countdown if a button is clicked.
Requirements:
	-> Use setTimeout to decrement the timer every second.
	-> Use a callback to stop when the timer reaches 0.
	-> Implement a button to cancel the countdown using clearTimeout.

Que 5 :
-------

	File Upload Simulator

Simulate a file upload process where:

	-> The upload progress updates every second.
	-> The upload completes after 5 seconds.
	-> The user can cancel the upload mid-process.
Requirements:
	-> Use setTimeout to update progress periodically.
	-> Use callbacks to display a completion message after the upload.
	-> Implement clearTimeout to allow canceling the upload.
