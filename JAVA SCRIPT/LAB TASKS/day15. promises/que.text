You are working for a food delivery company. Your task is to create a program that simulates the food delivery process. The program will have three steps:

Order Placed: Simulate a customer placing an order.
Food Prepared: Simulate the kitchen preparing the order after a delay.
Order Delivered: Simulate the delivery of the order to the customer after preparation.
Write a JavaScript program using Promises to perform these steps sequentially. Each step should resolve after a certain time delay, and the final output should confirm the order is delivered.

	-> create 3 arrow function with reference variable placeOrder, prepareFood, deliverOrder.
	-> each function returns a new promise and logs the user with the steps given as follows with the delay of 3 seconds.

	-> Use setTimeout to simulate delays.
	-> The output for each step should be printed in the console.
	-> Ensure that each step only begins after the previous one has been completed.

Example Output:

Order placed successfully.
Food is being prepared.
Order delivered to the customer.

You are building a social media application. When a user opens their profile, you need to fetch their name from the database. Simulate this process with a 2-second delay. If the user ID exists, return the user's name; otherwise, return an error.

    -> create one object with name database and add some values like userId, password, and phoneNumber .
    -> create one arrow function with reference variable named, fetchuserdata that returns a promise with the delay of 2 seconds.
    -> if the given username present in the object database resolve the promise else reject.

sample input:
	userid : 1

sample output :
	user : admin


sample input:
	userid : 10
	

sample output :
	user not found

	User Login

	An online portal needs to verify user credentials. If the username and password are correct, resolve with a success message; otherwise, reject with an error.

	-> create one arrow function with the reference variable loginUser and two parameters username and password.
	-> return a new promise to arrow function which validates the username and password with the delay of 2 seconds.
	-> promise will be resolved if the username and password matches else rejected.

sample input:
	username : admin
	password : admin123

sample output :
	login successful


sample input:
	username : ravin
	password : admin123

sample output :
	invalid username or password
